# bSDD buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD)
The bSDD is a system to maintain structures for the localization of the IFC schema and structures for expressing business Semantics on top of the IFC schema.  More info on https://www.buildingsmart.org/users/services/buildingsmart-data-dictionary/


## Very useful links

 * FAQ (what does it cost? what is it? how does it relate to IFC? etc..): [bSDD](https://www.buildingsmart.org/users/services/buildingsmart-data-dictionary/)

## Use the bSDD 
 * The API URL [API](https://api.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/); [Swagger documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/buildingSMART/Dictionaries/) 
 * [Search the data in the live/production bSDD](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/)  

## Test the bSDD
* [TEST API (swagger)](https://test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/swagger/) 
* [Search the data in the test database](https://search-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/)
* [Manage your data in the test database](https://manage-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/)
* Import format you can use to get data into the bSDD: [JSON](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/blob/master/Model/Import%20Model/bsdd-import-model.json) and [documentation](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/blob/master/Model/Import%20Model/bSDD%20JSON%20import%20model.md).
Data owners are encouraged to put their data in the test environment first, and communicate to bsdd_support@buildingsmart.org when they want to push it to the production environment.
