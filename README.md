**The buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD)** is an online service for hosting data dictionaries containing classifications, their properties, allowed values, units, translations, etc. It provides a standardized workflow to improve data quality and information consistency.

At the heart of bSDD is a database, where all dictionaries can be related to each other. The main way to access the bSDD is through its [APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/buildingSMART/Dictionaries/v1). This is how most BIM software and other apps can use the data stored in the bSDD. Apart from that, there is [the bSDD Search page](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/), where people can look up the content. Authors can publish content to bSDD through [the API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/buildingSMART/Dictionaries/v1) or [the Management Portal](https://manage.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/). To be able to upload, please fill out [the organisation registration form](https://bsi-technicalservices.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/group/4/create/25).
