**The buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD)** is an online service that hosts classifications and their properties, allowed values, units and translations. The bSDD allows linking between all the content inside the database. It provides a standardized workflow to improve data quality and information consistency.

The most important part of the bSDD are the APIs, Application Programming Interfaces, accessible via the internet. Using those APIs other tools and systems can use the data stored in the bSDD.

## Updates

We inform about planned and recently implemented bSDD updates that might affect you in this forum thread:

### Using the bSDD

* Search in the bSDD: https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/
* Upload data: https://manage.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/ 

We also provide a **Test** environment to play with, for those who want to experiment with bSDD first. We encourage to try **Test** before publishing in the actual bSDD. You can access it via:  

* Search in the **Test** bSDD: https://search-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/
* Upload data to the **Test** database: https://manage-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/

> Note: 
> 
> The bSDD is meant to be API-first, so the Search Page doesn't display all the content of bSDD.
> 
> To be able to upload domains, create an account first and email to <bsdd_support@buildingsmart.org> to ask for access.
> 
> If you encounter a login issue on, e.g. some kind of looping, try clearing your browser cache or start an 'incognito' browser window.
