# How to import your bSDD model into bSDD?

If you have your model in the bsdd-import-model.json format available, you can upload it into the bSDD database yourself.

*Important* if you upload a file it will replace the whole domain! You cannot upload the classifications in parts, all classifications and properties of one domain must be in one file.


1. Go to [bs-dd-api-prototype.azurewebsites.net/swagger](https://bs-dd-api-prototype.azurewebsites.net/swagger)

2. Press "Authorize"
![Authorize for bSDD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/master/2020%20prototype/import-model/doc_images/Screenshot_02_authorize.png)

Check the "read" scope checkmark and press Authorize.

3. If you do not have a bSDD buildingSMART account yet, choose "Sign up now", otherwise choose "Sign in"

Press "Close"

5. If it's the first time you are going to upload, you need to have your e-mail address, the one you used to log in, connected to your organization. To achieve this, send an e-mail with
- your name
- your e-mail address you used to log in the bSDD API
- the name of your organization
- a hyperlink to the website of your organization
- (optional) contact e-mail address in case users have questions about the domain you uploaded
to bsdd_support@buildingsmart.org.
As soon as you've got a reply, you can continue with the next step.

6. Click on the line with "/api/UploadImportFile"

7. Press "Try it out"
![Try the upload](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/master/2020%20prototype/import-model/doc_images/Screenshot_06_upload_2.png)

8. Enter the Organization Code of your organization (you should have received it by e-mail as a result of step 5), select your bSDD.json file and press Execute.
![Upload result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/master/2020%20prototype/import-model/doc_images/Screenshot_07_upload_result.png)

If there are any validation errors detected you will see them listed. You will receive a more detailed import report, one that might include warnings, by e-mail once the file has been imported.
