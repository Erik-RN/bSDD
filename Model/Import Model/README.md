You can find all the bSDD documentation in [Documentation](/Documentation/) folder. When it comes to importing, we recommend reading about: 
 [bSDD JSON import model](/Documentation/bSDD%20JSON%20import%20model.md), explaining what content can be stored in bSDD, and [bSDD import tutorial](/Documentation/bSDD%20import%20tutorial.md) with guidance on uploading that to the bSDD.
