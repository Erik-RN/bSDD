In case you would like to have your classifications and properties in the bSDD database, the best is to deliver them in the [bSDD import-model JSON](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/tree/master/Model/Import%20Model/bsdd-import-model.json) format.
Please read the [guidelines for using the JSON on this page](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/blob/master/Model/Import%20Model/bSDD%20JSON%20import%20model.md).

We also have an [Access database](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/tree/master/Model/Import%20Model/BSDD-import-data-accdb.zip)  (in zip file) with which you can deliver data. This Access database is a simplified version of the JSON model. Most of the explanation in the "bSDD JSON import model.md" doc is also valid for the Access database. Have a look at the design view of the tables in the Access database to see some additional info. If you want to use some of the more 'advanced' features, you should use the JSON model.

If you would like to deliver the data in a custom format, please contact us at bsdd_support@buildingsmart.org.

**IMPORTANT**: the new bSDD API is continuously under development. This means things may change. Check this Github site regularly! If you have any question regarding this subject send a mail to bsdd_support@buildingsmart.org.
