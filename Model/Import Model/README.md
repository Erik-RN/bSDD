In case you would like to have your classifications and properties in the bSDD database, the best is to deliver them in the [bSDD import-model JSON](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/tree/master/Model/Import%20Model/bsdd-import-model.json) format.
Please read the [guidelines for using the JSON on this page](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/blob/master/Model/Import%20Model/bSDD%20JSON%20import%20model.md).

If you would like to deliver the data in a custom format, please contact us at bsdd_support@buildingsmart.org.

**IMPORTANT**: If you have any question regarding this subject send a mail to bsdd_support@buildingsmart.org.
