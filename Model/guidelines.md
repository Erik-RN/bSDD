Guidelines for bSDD input

# General tips and tricks

- Manage and publish translations in a seperate file.
- Make specific domains, don't try to put too many data into one domain.
- Link to IFC entities for increased usability.
- Add IFC properties to your content instead of replicating your own properties.
- Make sure you use the correct encoding of characters. 

# General Naming conventions and guidelines
Avoid names that conflict with other domains. For example, do not create classifications with an 'Ifc'-prefix. Do not replicate content from other domains, but link to it. 

## Domain name
The domain name needs to be unique. Avoid the use of a name that is generic; choose a domain name that is specific. Global names like 'building products' are not allowed. Add your region or applition (use case application, not software) to the name of the domain to make it specific.

## Domain code
The domain code needs to be unique in the bSDD; choose one that is recognizable with the domain name.
The domain code is used in the URI of all the data, so choose carefully. 

## Organisation name
The organisation name (and URI code) will be assigned by the bSDD team, but suggestions can be made.

## Property set names
Avoid the use of 'Pset_' prefix. This is restricted for IFC only.
Avoid replicating the name of the property or class/classification.
